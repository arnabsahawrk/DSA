Subsequence vs. Substring vs. Subarray vs. Subset
---------------------------------------------------
- Subsequence: A sequence derived by removing elements without changing order.
    * Example: "Hello" → ["Hel", "Ho", "Hll"] (✔) but not "lh" (✘).

- Substring: A contiguous part of a string (no gaps).
   * Example: "Hello" → ["Hel", "llo"] (✔) but not "hll" (✘).

- Subarray: Same as a substring, but in an array.

Subset: Any selection of elements in any order, contiguous or not.

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
------------------------------------
* The longest subsequence that appears in the same order in two given sequences.

Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
-------------------------------
* A tree connecting all nodes in a graph with the minimum total edge weight.

- Properties:
   * No Cycles (A spanning tree cannot have a loop).
   * Only One Unique Path between any two nodes.
