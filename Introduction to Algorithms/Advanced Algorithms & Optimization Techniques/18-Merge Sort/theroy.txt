Merge Sort
--------------

Algorithm Type: Divide and Conquer

Process:
--------
- Divide: Recursively split the array into halves until each subarray contains a single element. 

- Conquer: Merge the subarrays back together in sorted order. 

Time Complexity: O(NlogN)

Space Complexity: O(N) due to the auxiliary space required for merging.

Stability: Merge Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it maintains the relative order of equal elements. 

Advantages:
------------
- Efficient for large datasets.
- Performs well on linked lists and external sorting.

Disadvantages:
----------------
- Requires additional memory proportional to the input size.
- Generally slower than in-place algorithms like Quick Sort for smaller datasets.

Use Cases:
------------
- Situations where stability is required.
- Sorting linked lists.
- External sorting (e.g., sorting data stored in external memory).

Merge Sort is a fundamental algorithm that exemplifies the divide-and-conquer paradigm, making it a critical concept in computer science and programming.
