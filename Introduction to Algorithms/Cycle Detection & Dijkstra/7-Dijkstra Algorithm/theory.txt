Dijkstra Algorithm: single source shortest distance. (SSSP)

Usually for find out shortest distance from a single source we can use BFS and the BFS algorithm has a better time complexity but it has a limitation also that BFS can work only unweighted graph.

So, for find out shortest distance from a single source in a weighted graph we need dijkstra algorithm.

There is path relaxation concept for dijkstra, the concept is checking if going through a new point gives us a shorter route to somewhere else, and if it does, updating our route.
