Single Source Shortest Distance
---------------------------------
- BFS
- Dijkstra
- Bellman-Ford

All Pair Shortest Distance
----------------------------
- Floyd-Warshall

When there is multiple query and for every query the source vertex is different then we should use Floyd-Warshall Algorithm. It gives a better complexity than BFS, Dijkstra, and Bellman-Ford. In that case most of the time we will get TLE if we use BFS, Dijkstra, and Bellman-Ford.

For Floyd-Warshall we have to use Adjacency Matrix. Floyd-Warshall also can detect negative weighted cycle.


Time Complexity
---------------
BFS: O(V+E)

Dijkstra: O(ElogV)

Bellman-Ford: O(V*E)

Floyd-Warshall: O(V^3)
