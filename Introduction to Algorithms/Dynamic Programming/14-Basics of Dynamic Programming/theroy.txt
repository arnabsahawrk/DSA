Dynamic Programming -> (Recursion + Optimization)
--------------------------------------------------
-> A recursive solution what we are try to optimized. It's just a process or technique, not a algorithm. With this approach we can mitigate the time complexity.

* When we call a recursion function and the recursion function is do some duplicate work we can optimized it by memorization.

Two types of DP
----------------
1. Top-Down approach (using recursion)
2. Bottom-Up approach (using loop)

* Top-Down approach called memorization, its time complexity O(N)
* Bottom-Up approach called tabulation, its time complexity O(N)
