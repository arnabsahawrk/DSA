Limitation of Frequency Array:

1. only integer count. we can't count an string or double data because we count the data depend on index and index is always integer start from 0 so, we can't count negative value as well.

2. fixed index (0 to 10000). we can't count beyond 10000

3. memory waste. if we have 1, 20, 20, data and count that in a frequency array in the middle 2 to 19 this a memory waste.


Array -> index, value

so for avoid this limitation we can use 'map'.

Map -> key, value
