/*
Big O
Linear Complexity --> O(N)
Logarithmic Complexity --> O(logN)
Sqrt Complexity --> O(sqrt(N))
Quadratic Complexity --> O(N*N)
Linearithmic Complexity --> O(NlogN)

Time Complexity vary on OS, same can code execute takes different time in different OS. Time Complexity don't fix with times.

O(N) - Order of N/Big O of N

Asymptotic Notations:
-->Omega notation (Ω) - Best Case
-->Theta notation (θ) - Average Case
-->Big O notation (O) - Worst Case

Rules to calculate time complexity:
1. Always take the worst case
2. Ignore The Constant

O(N-1), O(N/2), O(2N) --> ignore the constant O(N)
ignore it because that doesn't make too much different if our code can execute O(N) it can execute O(N-1), O(N/2), O(2N).
